In my homework, I manageed to change the background's color and size, the size range of the bubbles, the color fill and stroke of the bubbles, and the motions of the bubbles. I tried to approach the challenge but I failed to do so. 
However I understanded the code more during the process of trying out. I realize that the movements of the bubbles are formed by consistantly drawing new bubbles and backgrounds, and cover each other. And this is the why I have the difficulty to add more bubbles, because the background will alway cover the new bubble.
